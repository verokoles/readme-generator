# Issues and Pull Requests
You can contribute to the project without writing any code by submitting issues and pull requests as they come in.

Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest labels that can help categorize issues.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
- Ask for test plans and review code.

# Branch Organization
 One primary branch MAIN and use feature branches with deploy previews to deliver new features with pull requests.

 # Bugs
PLease use GitHub Issues for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, see if someone already opened an issue about it. If this is a new bug, you can submit a bug report.

One issue, one bug: Please report a SINGLE BUG per issue.
Provide reproduction steps: List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.
If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend filing an issue detailing what you're fixing. (in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.)
